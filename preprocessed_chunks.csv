PIPL Art. 4. ‘controller’ means: (GDPR) the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law;"

2.5 Rights of the Individual,0,200,"The data subject also has rights under the GDPR. These consist of: 1. The right to be informed 2. The right of access 3. The right to rectification 4. The right to erasure 5. The right to restrict processing 6. The right to data portability 7. The right to object 8. Rights in relation to automated decision making and profiling.

PIPL Art. 47. The PIPL also creates a right to data portability, provided any transfer to a new handler satisfies the conditions prescribed by the relevant enforcement authorities. PIPL Art. 45."
2.6 Lawfulness of Processing,0,41,"It is Institute for Supply Management policy to identify the appropriate basis for processing and to document it, in accordance with both regulations and other regulation that might impact our operations.

2.6.2 Performance of a Contract,0,159,"Where the personal data collected and processed are required to fulfil a contract with the data subject, explicit consent is not required under GDPR. This will often be the case where the contract cannot be completed without the personal data in question. For example, the delivery of an order will require an email address and/or a physical address. PIPL provides several legal bases for processing PI: Obtaining individuals’ consent. Where necessary for the performance of a contract to which the individual concerned is a party, or for the implementation of human resources management. Where necessary for the performance of statutory responsibilities or obligations. Where necessary for responding to a public health emergency or protecting the life, health, or property of individuals in cases of emergency.

Where otherwise permitted by laws and regulations."

2.6.3 Legal Obligation,0,50,"If the personal data is required to be collected and processed in order to comply with the law, then explicit consent is not required under GDGR. This may be the case for some data related to employment and taxation for example, and for many areas addressed by the public sector."
2.6.4 Vital Interests of the Data Subject,0,64,"In a case where the personal data are required to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person, then this may be used as the lawful basis of the processing.

2.6.6 Legitimate Interests,0,57,"If the processing of specific personal data is in the legitimate interests of Institute for Supply Management and is judged not to affect the rights and freedoms of the data subject in a significant way, then this may be defined as the lawful reason for the processing under GDPR. The reasoning behind this view will be documented."
2.7 Privacy by Design,0,130,"Institute for Supply Management has adopted the principle of privacy by design and will ensure that the definition and planning of all new or significantly changed systems that collect or process personal data will be subject to due consideration of privacy issues, including the completion of one or more data protection impact assessments.

The DPO is required to have an appropriate level of knowledge and can either be an in-house resource or outsourced to an appropriate service provider. Based on these criteria, Institute for Supply Management does not require a Data Protection Officer to be appointed. A “PI handler” refers to organizations and individuals that independently determine the purposes and means of processing PI. Institute for Supply Management’s data handlers can be reached at 1+ 480.752.6276."
